- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Derek, a Data Science PhD student at Chapman University in Orange, CA, USA. 
- I conduct research into superoscillations - local wave frequencies that are faster than the wave's actual bandlimits - and their applications in superresolution and imaging in radar and optics.
- I formerly attendedd and conducted research in gravitational-wave astrophysics at Califronia State University, Fullerton.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science, machine learning, and their applications in physics-based research.
- I come with both experience in and a love for building generative deep neural networks.
